23/04/23, 5:51 pm - +91 98674 66183: Not personal (obviously) but if a tier 3 company ( <5 lakhs) gives you a tier 2 package ( ≥5 lakhs) then you get disqualified and aren't allowed to appear for any interviews for the entire tier 2 bracket (5-10 lakhs)


Toh moral of the story- don't sit for the interviews of companies you'd not like to get a package from.  Agar galti se milgaya toh placement se bahar hojaoge
23/04/23, 5:54 pm - +91 75174 90835: Isme likha he kisi ne koi company ke interview me baithne se mana Kiya toh bhi disqualify
23/04/23, 5:55 pm - +91 98674 66183: Tiers ka option rehta hai though

23/04/23, 5:56 pm - +91 75174 90835: Choose karne ka choice nai hota he ig 
Voh log hi bifurcate karte he sabh students ko alag alag tier me
23/04/23, 5:57 pm - +91 98674 66183: Could be, I maybe missing something. But higher tiers are definitely allowed to sit for lower tier interviews.
23/04/23, 5:58 pm - +91 75174 90835: Hmm
23/04/23, 7:53 pm - +91 98674 66183: Agar saare rounds clear kardiye aur last me nahi baithe interview ke liye toh red flag lag jaayega tere naam pe

This is also killing biodiversity in surrounding areas and leading many fisherfolks and farmers to lose their livelihood. I'm asking BMC for a better waste management system because I'm tired of seeing so many people and the environment being affected. The stench and waste in Mumbai disgusts me and I want to put an end to this. Join me- https://bit.ly/mumbaistinks

30/09/23, 7:21 pm - +91 95554 81064: Don't delay acting on a good idea. Chances are someone else has thought of it too. Success comes to the one who acts first.
Never say "sorry" to another driver after a car accident. It's an admission of guilt and could be used against you in court.
Take a pen to your interview. Asking for a pen during an interview gives a bad impression and you'd be surprised how many people do it.
When you're thinking about buying something you don't necessarily need, imagine the item in one hand and the cash in the other. Which one would you take?
Never send your resume as a word file. Instead, print it to a PDF file, it's much cleaner and professional looking.
If you are in for a long drive at night, listen to comedians while driving. It's impossible to fall asleep while laughing.
Success isn't the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you'll be successful.
The two most effective treatments for battling depression are exercise and spending time with pets.
The greatest things never come from inside your comfort zone.
If someone cuts you off give them the "thumbs down" instead of the middle finger. They'll think about their actions more, instead of feeling unwarranted anger towards you.
Don't avoid cameras during your years in school or on vacation/holiday. You might not want to now, but you'll appreciate it later.
One of the best ways to judge a person's character is to see how they treat animals.
If you don’t like where you are, move on. You are not a tree.
If you're ever in a fight, the best spots to hit are the spots where it feels good to be massaged.
Want someone's number at a party? Take a picture with them and ask them to send it to you.
There is only one person you spend your whole life with, and that is yourself. If you aren't ok with you, there is an issue.
You can buy fun, but you can't buy happiness. Don't get the two confused.
